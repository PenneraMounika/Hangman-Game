HANGMAN GAME
This is a Python-based Hangman Game implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word, with limited attempts before the game ends. It also includes ASCII art for a visual representation of the Hangman.

Installation & Running Instructions:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/PenneraMounika/Hangman-Game.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd Hangman-Game
3. Run the game: python Oops_Hangman.py

Files Included:
Oops_Hangman.py → Main game logic using OOP.
picture.py → Contains ASCII art for the Hangman stages.

Features:
Object-Oriented Approach – Uses classes and methods.
ASCII Art Representation – Visualizes the Hangman at different stages.
Interactive Gameplay – Allows user input with real-time feedback.
Error Handling – Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Future Improvements:
Improve word selection by integrating an external API.
Add a graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.
Implement a difficulty level selection.
